## API Routes

### `/api/verse`

- **Purpose:** Fetch Bible verses from ESV API.
- **Request:** POST with body containing `verse` (string).
- **Response:** JSON object with keys: `passages` (array of verse texts), `query` (original query).

### `/api/commentary`

- **Purpose:** Generate AI commentary on Bible verses.
- **Request:** POST with body containing `verse` (string), `content` (string).
- **Response:** JSON object with keys:
  - `historical_context` (string)
  - `general_meaning` (string) - 1-2 sentences explaining the verse's meaning in simple terms
  - `commentary` (object with summarize, expose, change, prepare)
  - `application` (string)
  - `denominational_perspectives` (object with protestant, baptist, catholic)
  - `themes` (array of exactly 3 theme strings selected for their relevance to the verse)
  - `reflective_question` (string) - A short, thought-provoking question for personal application
- **Theme Restriction:** Only returns themes from the pre-defined list: faith, love, hope, grace, mercy, peace, wisdom, truth, salvation, righteousness, joy, forgiveness, obedience, humility, trust, prayer, service, holiness, redemption, eternity, teaching, accountability.
- **Theme Processing:**
  - Enhanced OpenAI prompt strictly enforces theme selection from the pre-defined list
  - Improved theme mapping logic to avoid duplicates and select more relevant alternatives
  - Alternative theme mappings prioritize contextually appropriate themes (e.g., strength â†’ wisdom rather than hope)
  - Ensures exactly 3 unique and relevant themes are returned, even if OpenAI returns duplicates or non-allowed themes

### `/api/like`

- **Purpose:** Like or unlike a reflection.
- **Request:** POST with body containing userId, reflectionId, like (boolean, true to like, false to unlike).
- **Response:** JSON object with keys: success (boolean), likes (updated number of likes), likedBy (array of user IDs who liked the reflection).
- **Processing:**
  - Updates the likes count based on the user's action (increment when liking, decrement when unliking)
  - Manages the liked_by array to track which users have liked each reflection
  - Returns the updated likes count and liked_by array in the response
  - Note: This API route is actually used as a fallback, as the app now primarily uses the Supabase RPC toggle_like function

## Database Schema

### `reflections` table

- `id` (uuid, primary key)
- `user_id` (uuid, foreign key)
- `verse` (text)
- `verse_text` (text)
- `question` (text)
- `answer` (text)
- `insight` (text)
- `themes` (text\[\]) - Always contains exactly 3 themes from the pre-defined list
- `likes` (integer, default 0)
- `liked_by` (uuid\[\]) - Array of user IDs who liked the reflection
- `created_at` (timestamp)

### `reading_log` table

- `id` (uuid, primary key)
- `user_id` (uuid, foreign key)
- `verse` (text)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

### `users` table

- `id` (uuid, primary key)
- `name` (text)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

## Supabase Functions

### `toggle_like` function

- **Purpose:** Toggle like status for a reflection directly in the database.
- **Parameters:**
  - `p_reflection_id` (uuid) - The ID of the reflection to toggle like for
  - `p_user_id` (uuid) - The ID of the user toggling the like
  - `p_like` (boolean) - Whether to like (true) or unlike (false)
- **Returns:** JSON object with updated likes count and liked_by array.
- **Implementation:**
  - Fetches current likes and liked_by with row locking to prevent race conditions
  - Adds or removes user from liked_by array based on p_like parameter
  - Updates likes count accordingly (increment when adding, decrement when removing)
  - Returns JSON object with updated values for client-side state updates
  - Includes error handling for non-existent reflections
- **Client Usage:**
  - Called via `supabase.rpc("toggle_like", {...})` with appropriate parameters
  - The client-side handleLike function now automatically determines whether to like or unlike based on the current state
  - UUID validation is performed on both IDs before making the RPC call
  - Improved error handling with detailed error logging
