# Bible Study App - Grok Summary for New Conversation (April 12, 2025)

## Purpose
The Bible study app empowers users to engage deeply with Scripture through AI-guided commentary, personal reflections, and community interaction. Built with Next.js, Supabase, and OpenAI, it's designed to be intuitive, encouraging, and accessible for a broad audienceâ€”especially beginners and those exploring faith. The app aims to foster spiritual growth, simplify Bible study, and grow to 100+ users with a mobile-first, desktop-compatible design.

## Project Overview
This Next.js 14 application blends modern web technology with spiritual engagement, offering a seamless platform for studying Bible verses. Users input verses, receive clear AI-generated insights, reflect on their meaning, and connect with a community through shared reflections, all wrapped in a calming dark mode UI (gray-800 to blue-900, sky-400 accents, Poppins font). The app prioritizes ease of use on mobile devices, ensuring touch-friendly navigation and fast load times, while supporting desktop layouts for flexibility. Its core goal is to make Scripture approachable, encouraging daily engagement and a closer connection to God.

## Current Structure
- **Technologies**:
  - Next.js 14 (App Router) for dynamic routing and server-side rendering.
  - TypeScript for type-safe code (e.g., interfaces for commentary, reflections).
  - Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling.
  - OpenAI API for generating verse commentary and reflective questions.
  - ESV Bible API for fetching accurate verse text.
  - Supabase for database storage (reflections, users, reading logs) and authentication.

- **Pages**:
  - **Homepage** (`app/page.tsx`):
    - Hero section with parallax background, organic shapes (sky-400/10), and gradient title (sky-400 to blue-600).
    - Introduction with three feature cards highlighting Guided Commentary, Denominational Perspectives, and Reflections.
    - Verse of the Day with a modal preview, pulling from a static list (`dailyVerses`).
    - User creation/selection form using Supabase, with validation and error handling (red-400 alerts).
    - Mobile-first layout with ripple animations and smooth scrolling.

  - **Reading Page** (`reading/page.tsx`):
    - Verse input with suggestions (e.g., John 3:16), integrated with ESV API.
    - AI commentary displayed in ordered sections: Verse, Key Themes (three per verse), General Meaning, Historical Context, Reading it Right, Application, Denominational Perspectives, Reflective Question.
    - "Reading it Right" methodology card explaining Summarize, Expose, Change, Prepare, based on 2 Timothy 3:16-17.
    - Reflection form requiring 10-character minimum answers, with optional insight and sharing toggle.
    - Sidebar showing shared reflections (last 30 days) with carousel navigation, play/pause controls, and like functionality.
    - Responsive design with mobile-first padding, sticky navigation, and back-to-top button.

- **API Routes**:
  - `api/verse/route.ts`: Fetches verse text from ESV API, handles formatting and errors.
  - `api/commentary/route.ts`: Uses OpenAI to generate commentary, strictly returning three themes from 22 predefined options (e.g., faith, love, hope) with advanced mapping to avoid duplicates. Includes "Reading it Right" subsections, denominational views, and fallbacks for reliability.
  - `api/like/route.ts`: Updates reflection likes and tracks user IDs in `liked_by` array via Supabase.

- **Components**:
  - `CommentarySkeleton.tsx`: Placeholder UI during commentary loading, matching card layouts.
  - `ThemeChip.tsx`: Renders color-coded theme tags (e.g., blue-600/20 for faith) with icons (e.g., CrossIcon).
  - `NavigationHeader.tsx`: Provides consistent navigation across pages (Home, Reading, Metrics).

- **Database (Supabase)**:
  - `users`: Stores profiles (id, name, created_at) and auth data.
  - `reflections`: Saves verse reflections with fields (verse, verse_text, question, answer, insight, is_shared, themes as text[], likes as integer, liked_by as text[]).
  - `reading_log`: Tracks reading history (user_id, verse, created_at).

- **Styling**:
  - Dark mode gradient (gray-800 to blue-900), sky-400 accents for interactivity.
  - Mobile-first with adaptive desktop layouts (`flex-col` on mobile, `flex-row` on desktop).
  - Card-based UI (`bg-blue-900/30`, `border-sky-500/20`) with Poppins font.
  - Animations (fade-ins, ripples), loading spinners (sky-400), error/success states (red-400/green-400).

- **Documentation**:
  - `instructions.txt`: UI/UX specs (dark mode, sky-400, Poppins), theme config (22 themes with colors/icons), API details.
  - `docs/reading-page.md`: Reading Page rules, including section order, "Reading it Right" card, sidebar details, and theme debugging steps.
  - `project_structure.txt`: Overview of app architecture and features (stored in `BibleStudyApp/`).
  - `docs/improvements.md`: Tracks planned enhancements and priorities.
