Bible Study App - Grok Summary for New Conversation (August 28, 2024)

## Purpose
The Bible Study App empowers users to engage deeply with Scripture through AI-guided commentary, personal reflections, and community interaction. Built with Next.js, Supabase, and OpenAI, it's designed to be intuitive, encouraging, and accessible for a broad audienceâ€”especially beginners and those exploring faith. The app fosters spiritual growth, simplifies Bible study, and aims to grow to 100+ users with a mobile-first, desktop-compatible design.

## Project Overview
This Next.js 14 application blends modern web technology with spiritual engagement, offering a seamless platform for studying Bible verses. Users input verses, receive clear AI-generated insights, reflect on their meaning, and connect with a community through shared reflections, all wrapped in a calming dark mode UI (gray-800 to blue-900, sky-400 accents, Poppins font). The app prioritizes ease of use on mobile devices, ensuring touch-friendly navigation and fast load times, while supporting desktop layouts for flexibility. Its core goal is to make Scripture approachable, encouraging daily engagement and a closer connection to God. Recent updates have improved authentication with server-side validation, enhanced session handling, and added comprehensive testing guidance to ensure a secure and user-friendly experience.

## Current Structure

### Technologies:
- **Next.js 14 (App Router)** for dynamic routing and server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript** for type-safe code (e.g., interfaces for commentary, reflections, session/user types).
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, utility-first styling.
- **OpenAI API** for generating verse commentary and reflective questions.
- **ESV Bible API** for fetching accurate verse text.
- **Supabase** for database storage (reflections, users, reading logs), authentication, and RPC functions.

### Pages:

#### Homepage (app/page.tsx):
- Hero section with parallax background, organic shapes (sky-400/10), and gradient title (sky-400 to blue-600).
- Introduction with three feature cards highlighting Guided Commentary, Denominational Perspectives, and Reflections.
- "Begin your Journey" card with a gradient background (from-sky-800 to-blue-900) and BookOpenIcon, vertically stacked Sign Up with Email and Sign In buttons, mobile-first layout (image top, content bottom), subtle background zoom on desktop, and Dribbble-inspired styling.
- "Reading it Right" card with a summary of the method (based on 2 Timothy 3:16-17, four purposes: Summarize, Expose, Change, Prepare), a link to the website (https://express.adobe.com/page/sOKudzmtRQPm4/), and an image (/readingitright.jpg); text on the left and image on the right on desktop, image on top and text below on mobile.
- Verse of the Day with a modal preview, pulling from a static list (dailyVerses in data/verses.ts).
- User creation/selection form using Supabase, with email/password login, validation, and error handling (red-400 alerts).
- Error messages clear when switching between signup and signin modes for a seamless user experience.
- Session validation now uses server-side checks with improved security and reliability.
- Mobile-first layout with ripple animations and smooth scrolling.
- Optimized Sign Up/Sign In modal with reduced padding, smaller field sizes, appropriate font sizes, and efficient spacing to fit within the viewport without scrolling. Mobile width reduced to max-w-sm, and Login/Google buttons horizontally aligned in a flex container for better space utilization.

#### Reading Page (app/reading/page.tsx):
- Verse input with suggestions (e.g., John 3:16), integrated with ESV API.
- AI commentary displayed in ordered sections: Verse, Key Themes (three per verse), General Meaning, Historical Context, Reading it Right, Application, Denominational Perspectives, Reflective Question.
- "Reading it Right" methodology card explaining Summarize, Expose, Change, Prepare, based on 2 Timothy 3:16-17.
- Reflection form requiring 10-character minimum answers, with optional insight and sharing toggle.
- Sidebar showing shared reflections (last 30 days) with carousel navigation, play/pause controls, and enhanced like functionality.
- Improved like functionality in the shared reflections that:
  - Automatically determines if a user has already liked a reflection
  - Uses a dedicated Supabase RPC function (toggle_like) for database operations
  - Validates UUIDs with regex pattern before submission
  - Provides detailed error logging for troubleshooting
  - Updates UI in real-time to show liked status and count
- Server-side session validation ensures only authenticated users can access the page, redirecting to / if no valid session exists.
- Error handling for session-related errors (e.g., Invalid Refresh Token) displays a user-friendly fallback UI with a "Return to Home" link.
- Background image (bible-background.jpg) is referenced but missing; a placeholder URL from Unsplash is currently used (https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1459666644539-a9755287d6ce?q=80&w=2012&auto=format&fit=crop).
- Responsive design with mobile-first padding, sticky navigation, and back-to-top button.

#### API Routes:
- **api/verse/route.ts**: Fetches verse text from ESV API, handles formatting and errors.
- **api/commentary/route.ts**: Uses OpenAI to generate commentary, strictly returning three themes from 22 predefined options (e.g., faith, love, hope) with advanced mapping to avoid duplicates. Includes "Reading it Right" subsections, denominational views, and fallbacks for reliability.
- **api/like/route.ts**: Updates reflection likes and tracks user IDs in liked_by array via Supabase. Acts as a fallback to the primary toggle_like RPC function.
- **api/auth/[...supabase]/route.ts**: Enhanced OAuth callback handler with improved error handling and redirects.

### Components:
- **CommentarySkeleton.tsx**: Placeholder UI during commentary loading, matching card layouts.
- **ThemeChip.tsx**: Renders color-coded theme tags (e.g., blue-600/20 for faith) with icons (e.g., CrossIcon), embedded in app/reading/page.tsx.
- **NavigationHeader.tsx**: Provides consistent navigation across pages (Home, Reading, Profile).
- **layout.server.tsx**: Server component that handles session validation and passes session data to client components.
- **layout.client.tsx**: Client component that receives session data from server and renders appropriate UI.

### Database (Supabase):
- **users**: Stores profiles (id, name, created_at) and auth data.
- **reflections**: Saves verse reflections with fields (verse, verse_text, question, answer, insight, is_shared, themes as text[], likes as integer, liked_by as uuid[]).
- **reading_log**: Tracks reading history (user_id, verse, created_at).

### Supabase Functions:
- **toggle_like**: RPC function that takes p_reflection_id, p_user_id, and p_like parameters to toggle a like on a reflection. Implements row locking for concurrent operations, updates likes count and liked_by array, and returns updated values as JSON.

### Styling:
- Dark mode gradient (gray-800 to blue-900), sky-400 accents for interactivity.
- Mobile-first with adaptive desktop layouts (flex-col on mobile, flex-row on desktop).
- Card-based UI (bg-blue-900/30, border-sky-500/20) with Poppins font.
- Animations (fade-ins, ripples), loading spinners (sky-400), error/success states (red-400/green-400).
